Controls: Players can control Annette's movement with the ARROW keys. While moving, players can walk in place by holding SHIFT, which will move the creatures opposite to Annette's direction. Summoning a box is controlled with SPACE. The distraction is conjured with X.  As usual, R will reset the level, ESC closes the game, and O will toggle debug mode.

Objective: Reach the lamp post while avoiding contact with the creatures. The box will obstruct creature and Annette's movement as well as the lines of sight until it is deactivated (indicated by the box going dark) or gone. It can be reactivated by walking into it, or, if Annette is next to it, removed by pressing space. The distraction has different effects on the different creatures. Walking in place will move the creatures and box until they hit environmental obstacles or until they reach a certain radius (indicated by the red glow). Currently, the box can go through buildings, which is a known bug.

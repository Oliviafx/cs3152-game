## Summary
When the lights go low in the City of Light, dangerous mythical creatures emerge to terrorize the streets, and mime Annette comes out to banish them. Using Annetteâ€™s powers of illusion, you will summon boxes and ropes to conceal her until she can dispel the monsters. While the citizens of Paris sleep, it is up to you to silently protect them from the menacing creatures that would do them harm.

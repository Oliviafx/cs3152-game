In this prototype, players can control both Annette and the creature. The WASD keys are used for Annette’s movement, while the arrow keys are used for the creature. Currently, Annette can push the box by walking into it. 

Players will lose if Annette either collides with the creature’s line of sight (indicated by the green cone) or the creature itself. Players win by getting Annette to the Well in the top-left corner.

As usual, pressing R will reset the level, and Esc closes the game window. Pressing O turns on debug mode.
